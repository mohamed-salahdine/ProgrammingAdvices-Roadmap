# 06 - C++ Level 2 🧬

**"Mastering Memory, Pointers, and Recursion."**

This directory covers intermediate C++ concepts that bridge the gap between basic scripting and software engineering. The focus moves beyond simple variables to understanding **Memory Management**, **Pointers**, and building **Custom Libraries**.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Mastered
- **Pointers & References:**
  - Understanding memory addresses (`&`) and dereferencing (`*`).
  - Pass-by-Value vs. Pass-by-Reference.
  - Pointers vs. Arrays.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Introduction to the concept of managing memory manually (Stack vs. Heap).
- **Recursion:** Solving problems by breaking them down into self-similar sub-problems (e.g., Fibonacci, Power calculation).
- **Vectors:** Transitioning from static arrays to dynamic `std::vector` for flexible data storage.
- **String Manipulation:** Advanced string formatting and built-in string methods.

## 📦 Building Libraries
- **Header Files (.h):** Created my first custom library `MyLib.h`.
- **Modularization:** Separated declarations from implementations to keep the codebase clean and reusable across multiple projects.

## 🛠️ Topics Implemented
- **Math Functions:** `ceil`, `floor`, `abs`, `round` (recreated manually to understand internal logic).
- **Validation:** Specialized functions to validate generic user input types.
- **Formatting:** Using `printf` and format specifiers for clean console output.

## 🧠 Why This Matters
Understanding pointers and references is crucial for backend performance. It taught me how data is actually passed around in the CPU, avoiding unnecessary data copying.

## 🛠️ Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio
