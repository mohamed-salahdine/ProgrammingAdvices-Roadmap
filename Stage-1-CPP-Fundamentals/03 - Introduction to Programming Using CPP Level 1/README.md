# 03 - C++ Level 1 💻

**"Translating logic into syntax."**

This directory marks the transition from abstract algorithms to executable **C++ code**. It contains the implementation of the 65+ problems from the previous level, now written in C++ to understand syntax, compilation, and basic execution flow.

## 🚀 Overview
Here lies the foundation of my software engineering journey. The focus is on writing clean, syntactically correct C++ code, understanding how the compiler interprets instructions, and handling basic Input/Output operations.

## 📚 Topics Implemented
- **Basic Structure:** `main()` function, headers, and namespaces.
- **Variables & Data Types:** `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `string`, `bool`.
- **Input/Output:** Using `cin` and `cout` streams.
- **Control Flow:**
  - `if`, `else if`, `else` statements.
  - `switch` case structures.
  - Nested conditions.
- **Loops (Iteration):** `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- **Arrays & Structures:** Introduction to storing collections of data and custom types (`struct`).
- **Functions:** Breaking logic into reusable blocks (modular programming).

## 💡 Key Takeaways
- **Strong Typing:** Understood the importance of declaring strict data types in C++.
- **Scope & Lifetime:** Learned how variable scope affects accessibility within loops and functions.
- **Problem Solving Implementation:** Successfully converted flowcharts into working C++ programs.

## 🛠️ Environment
- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Microsoft Visual Studio
- **Compiler:** MSVC
