# 07 - Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 3 📊

**"Mastering Matrices and String Processing."**

This directory focuses on manipulating **2D Arrays (Matrices)** and performing advanced operations on strings. It serves as the bridge between simple variable storage and complex data handling (like databases or Excel sheets).

## 🚀 Key Concepts
- **Matrices (2D Arrays):**
  - Iterating through rows and columns.
  - Matrix operations: Sum, Transpose, Multiplication, and checking for special types (Identity, Scalar, Sparse matrices).
  - Comparing two matrices for equality or existence of numbers.
- **Advanced String Manipulation:**
  - Building custom string libraries (`MyStringLib`).
  - Implementing logic for `Split`, `Trim`, `Join`, `Reverse`, and `Replace` functions manually.
  - Counting words, vowels, and specific characters.

## 📂 Implementation Details
- **Random Matrix Generator:** Filling 3x3 or NxN matrices with random numbers for testing.
- **Min/Max Search:** Finding specific values within a 2D structure.
- **Parsing Data:** Learning how to take a long string (like a CSV line) and split it into usable variables (a precursor to File I/O).

## 🧠 Why This Matters
- **Matrices:** Are the foundation of graphics, game development, and machine learning (tensors).
- **String Parsing:** Is essential for reading data files, processing user input, and communication between systems (JSON/XML parsing logic starts here).

## 🛠️ Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Focus:** 2D Arrays, Strings, and Logic.
