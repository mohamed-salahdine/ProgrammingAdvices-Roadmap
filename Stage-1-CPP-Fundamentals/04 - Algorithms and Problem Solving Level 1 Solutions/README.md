# 04 - Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 1 Solutions 📝

**"From Flowchart to Functional Code."**

This directory contains the concrete **C++ implementations** of the logical problems designed in *Algorithms Level 1*. While the previous levels focused on logic (flowcharts) and syntax (basics), this level brings them together to solve the 65+ fundamental problems programmatically.

## 🔨 Implementation Details
- **Logic Translation:** Direct mapping of flowcharts/pseudo-code to C++ syntax.
- **Input Validation:** Ensuring user inputs are handled correctly via `cin`.
- **Formatting:** Focus on clear output messages to improve User Experience (UX) in the console.

## 📂 Problem Categories Implemented
1.  **Arithmetic:** Calculators, Summation, Factorials.
2.  **Number Theory:** Prime checks, Perfect numbers, Palindromes.
3.  **Flow Control:** Loan approvals, Grade mapping, Pin code validation (3 attempts).
4.  **Loops:** Dynamic summation, Digit extraction, and inverted patterns.

## 💡 Code Quality Focus
- **Readable Variable Names:** Moved away from `x`, `y` to descriptive names like `TotalMarks`, `UserAge`.
- **Modularization:** While simple, the code begins to separate inputs, processing, and outputs.
- **Refactoring:** Comparing my initial solutions with optimized approaches to reduce lines of code and improve efficiency.

## 🛠️ Stack
- **Language:** C++ (Standard 11/14/17)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio
