# 10 - OOP as it Should Be (Concepts) 🏛️

**"Thinking in Objects."**

This directory marks the transition from Procedural Programming to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Here, I focus on architectural design, organizing code into **Classes** and **Objects** to mirror real-world entities, improving code maintainability and scalability.

## 🚀 The 4 Pillars of OOP
I have implemented and documented examples for the core pillars:
1.  **Encapsulation:** Protecting data using Access Specifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`) and controlled access via Getters/Setters.
2.  **Inheritance:** Promoting code reusability by allowing classes to inherit properties and behaviors from base classes.
3.  **Polymorphism:** Using Function Overloading and Overriding to allow flexible interfaces.
4.  **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details using Abstract Classes and Pure Virtual Functions.

## 📚 Key Concepts Implemented
- **Classes vs. Objects:** Understanding the blueprint vs. the instance.
- **Constructors & Destructors:** Managing resource initialization and cleanup.
- **Static Members:** Shared data across all instances of a class.
- **Friend Classes/Functions:** Understanding controlled access violations.
- **Nested Classes:** Organizing tightly coupled logic.

## 🧠 Why This Matters
OOP is the industry standard for large-scale software. It shifts the focus from "writing a script" to "designing a system," allowing for safer code (Encapsulation) and less repetition (Inheritance).
