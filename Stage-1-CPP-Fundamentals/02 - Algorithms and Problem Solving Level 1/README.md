# 02 - Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 1 🧩

**"Logic first, Syntax second."**

This directory contains solutions to **65+ algorithmic problems** solved using **Flowcharts** and **Pseudo-code**. This stage focuses purely on building the logical muscle required to solve problems efficiently before dealing with language-specific constraints.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To develop strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.
- To master the ability to visualize the flow of data through a program.
- To learn how to translate a real-world problem into a programmatic solution.

## 📂 Content Overview
This folder contains solutions for common algorithmic challenges, including:
- **Math & Logic:** Checking Prime numbers, Perfect numbers, Factorials, and Power calculations.
- **Conditional Logic:** Pass/Fail checks, Grade calculations, Max/Min value extraction.
- **Looping Structures:** Sum of odd/even numbers, digit reversal, and iterative counting.
- **Variable Tracing:** "Dry running" code on paper to predict output and verify logic.

## 🧠 Key Skills Acquired
- **Flowchart Design:** Visualizing complex logic using standard flowchart symbols.
- **Pseudo-code Writing:** Writing language-agnostic code logic.
- **Code Tracing:** The ability to mentally execute code step-by-step to catch logic errors (bugs) without a debugger.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Thinking about inputs like "0", negative numbers, or invalid data.

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Pen & Paper:** For initial logic mapping and tracing.
- **Flowgorithm (Optional):** For testing flowchart logic.
