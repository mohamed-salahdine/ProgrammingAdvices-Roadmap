**"Measuring Code Performance: Big O & Memory."**

This directory contains theoretical notes and conceptual work regarding **Algorithmic Complexity** and **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**. Before implementing complex data structures, this course focuses on analyzing *how efficient* a solution is.

## 🚀 Key Concepts
- **Big O Notation:**
  - Understanding Time Complexity (Speed) vs. Space Complexity (Memory).
  - Analyzing scenarios: O(1), O(n), O(log n), and O(n²).
  - Best case, Average case, and Worst case scenarios.
- **Memory Management Deep Dive:**
  - The Stack vs. The Heap.
  - Recursion overhead and stack overflow risks.
- **Abstract Data Types (ADTs):**
  - Conceptual understanding of Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Trees before implementation.

## 🧠 Why This Matters
Writing code that works is easy; writing code that **scales** is hard. This level taught me to look at a loop and immediately understand its impact on the CPU, which is critical for high-performance backend systems.

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Complexity Analysis:** Mental models for calculating algorithmic cost.
- **Diagrams:** Visualizing memory allocation during recursive calls.
