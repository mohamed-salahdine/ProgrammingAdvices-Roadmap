# 01 - Programming Foundations Level 1 🧠

**"Understand how computers think before you write code."**

This directory contains my notes, exercises, and conceptual work for **Programming Foundations Level 1**, the first stage of the ProgrammingAdvices roadmap by **Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud**.

## 📌 About This Course
Before diving into syntax or languages, this course focuses on the **mental model** of a computer. It covers how data is represented, processed, and stored at a fundamental level, providing the "under-the-hood" knowledge required for high-performance software engineering.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- **Computer Architecture Basics:** CPU, Memory (RAM), and Input/Output operations.
- **Data Representation:**
  - Binary, Decimal, Octal, and Hexadecimal systems.
  - Bitwise operations and how data travels through the bus.
- **Memory Management:**
  - How variables are actually stored in memory (Addresses & Values).
  - The concept of Data Types (Integers, Strings, Booleans) at a low level.
- **Logic & Flow Control:**
  - Understanding Sequential execution.
  - Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT).
  - Introduction to Algorithms and Flowcharts.
- **Code Execution:**
  - Source Code vs. Machine Code.
  - Compilers vs. Interpreters.

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Learned to visualize **memory allocation** for variables before writing a single line of code.
- Mastered converting between **Number Systems** (Binary/Hex) manually.
- Understood the distinction between **Hardware**, **Operating Systems**, and **Application Software**.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Flowcharts:** To map out logical solutions visually.
- **Pseudo-code:** To write language-agnostic logic.
- **Mental Models:** Simulating CPU execution for problem-solving.
