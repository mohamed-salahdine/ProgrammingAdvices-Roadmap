# 05 - Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 2 ⚙️

**"Breaking big problems into small, manageable functions."**

This directory contains advanced algorithmic solutions where the focus shifts from writing code in `main()` to **Modular Programming**. Here, I learned to decompose complex problems into smaller, reusable functions and libraries.

## 🚀 Key Concepts
- **Functional Decomposition:** Breaking a monolithic program into specific functions (e.g., `ReadPositiveNumber()`, `CheckPrime()`, `PrintHeader()`).
- **Code Reusability:** Creating a personal library of utility functions to use across different problems.
- **Input Validation:** Robust handling of user inputs to prevent crashes.
- **Math Algorithms:** Implementing mathematical logic without using built-in shortcuts.

## 🧩 Topics Covered
- **Advanced Math:**
  - Prime Number validation & listing.
  - Perfect Numbers & Palindromes.
  - Digit Reversal & Summation.
- **Encryption Basics:** Simple text encryption/decryption logic.
- **Randomness:** Generating random numbers, characters, and keys (Keys/Password Generators).
- **Arrays & Collections:** Searching, counting, and manipulating items within arrays.

## 🐛 Debugging Skills
- **Breakpoints & Watches:** Learned to use Visual Studio's debugger to inspect variable states at runtime.
- **Step-Over / Step-Into:** Navigating the call stack to understand function execution flow.

## 🛠️ Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Focus:** Logic, Functions, and Headers.
