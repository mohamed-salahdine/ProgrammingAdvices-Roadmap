# 13 - Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 5 🧠

**"Data Structures in the Wild."**

This final directory of Stage 1 applies the **Custom Data Structures** (Stacks, Queues, Dynamic Arrays) built in the previous level to solve real-world algorithmic challenges. It moves from *building* the tools to *using* them effectively.

## 🚀 Key Applications
- **Queue Management:** Simulating a "Ticket Queue" system (e.g., waiting lines at a bank).
- **Stack Operations:** Implementing **Undo/Redo** functionality using dual stacks.
- **Dynamic Array Extensions:** Adding advanced filtering and merging capabilities to my custom vector class.

## 📂 Topics Covered
- **Generic Programming:** Leveraging C++ Templates to handle various data types in algorithms.
- **Efficiency:** Choosing the right data structure for the job (e.g., using a Queue for First-In-First-Out scenarios).
- **Extension Methods:** Extending the functionality of the Data Structure library without modifying the core class files.

## 🏆 Roadmap Milestone
This concludes **Stage 1** of the ProgrammingAdvices roadmap.
- **Foundation:** Built from scratch.
- **OOP:** Applied.
- **Data Structures:** Implemented manually.

## 🛠️ Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Focus:** Application of Data Structures.
