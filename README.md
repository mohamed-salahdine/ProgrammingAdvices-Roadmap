# ProgrammingAdvices Roadmap – My Journey

My personal implementation, solutions, projects, notes, and certificates following Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud's structured programming roadmap from [programmingadvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com).

**Stage 1 – Completed** ✅ (Courses 01–13)  
Modern C++, Algorithms (Levels 1–5), OOP, Data Structures Level 1.

**Stage 2 – In Progress** (Courses 14–24)  
Professional C#, SQL, ADO.NET, advanced OOP, real-world projects (DVLD system upcoming).

### Recent Progress
- **Feb 2026** – Completed Course 15: Database Level 1 – SQL
