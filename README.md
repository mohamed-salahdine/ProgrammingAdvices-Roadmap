# ProgrammingAdvices Complete Roadmap Journey

My full implementation of Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud's legendary roadmap from [programmingadvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com)

**Stage 1 – Completed ✅ (Courses 01–13)**  
Mastered computational thinking, clean problem-solving, modern C++, OOP (concepts + real apps), and Data Structures Level 1.

**Stage 2 – In Progress 🚀 (Courses 14–24)**  
C#, SQL, ADO.NET, professional OOP in C#, and the famous real-world DVLD project.

## Progress
| Stage | Status        | Courses       | Main Topics                          |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1    | Completed ✅  | 01–13         | C++, Algorithms (L1–L5), OOP, DS L1 |
| 2    | In Progress   | 14–24         | C#, SQL, ADO.NET, Real Projects     |

## How to Navigate
- `Stage-1-CPP-Fundamentals/` → All C++ solutions & projects
- `Stage-2-CSharp-Professional/` → Will be filled as I progress
- Code is clean, well-commented, and follows the exact principles taught in the courses.

## Tech Stack
- Stage 1: Modern C++ (C++17/20)
- Stage 2: C# .NET, SQL Server, WinForms/WPF
