# ProgrammingAdvices Complete Roadmap Journey

My personal implementation, solutions, projects, notes, and certificates following Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud's structured programming roadmap from [programmingadvices.com](https://programmingadvices.com).

**Stage 1 – Completed ✅** (Courses 01–13)
Mastered computational thinking, clean & efficient problem-solving, modern C++, deep OOP concepts + real applications, and Data Structures Level 1.

**Stage 2 – In Progress** (Courses 14–24)  
Transitioning to professional C# development, SQL databases, ADO.NET connectivity, advanced OOP in C#, and building real-world applications (including the comprehensive DVLD – Driving License Management System project).

## Progress Overview

| Stage | Status          | Courses   | Core Topics                                      |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Completed ✅       | 01–13     | C++, Algorithms (Levels 1–5), OOP, Data Structures L1 |
| 2     | In Progress     | 14–24     | C#, SQL, ADO.NET, Professional OOP, Real Projects |

## Repository Structure & Navigation

- **`Stage-1-CPP-Fundamentals/`**  
  All completed C++ code, exercises, solutions, mini-projects, and per-course READMEs (with key concepts and takeaways).

- **`Stage-2-CSharp-Professional/`**  
  Reserved for upcoming C# courses, database work, projects, and future certificates (will be created when starting Course 14).

- **`Certificates/`**  
  Official completion certificates from programmingadvices.com (PDFs for Stage 1 so far; Stage 2 added as courses finish).

All code follows the clean, readable, and principled style emphasized throughout the roadmap.

## Tech Stack

- **Stage 1**: Modern C++ (C++17/20 features), GCC/Clang, Visual Studio / VS Code  
- **Stage 2**: C# (.NET), SQL Server, ADO.NET, WinForms/WPF (as taught)

## Certificates & Proof of Completion

Official completion certificates (PDF format) from programmingadvices.com are stored in the [`Certificates/`](./Certificates) folder.

Each per-course README inside `Stage-1-CPP-Fundamentals/` includes a quick link to the relevant certificate PDF in this folder for easy access and verification.

Stage 2 certificates will follow the same approach once those courses are completed.

## Contributing & Feedback

Open to discussions, suggestions, or issue reports — especially from others following the same ProgrammingAdvices roadmap!
